# Bomb_Tester : 

Its basically a game to check whether there is a bomb hidden inside a box or not.

Description :
 Lets see this problem vis 2 base conditions (same as in the txt file) :
 
 
Condition 1 ) --> (No Bomb)
Now we are going to have an arrangement of a beam splitter as shown in figure below , now when the photon hits the beam splitter , it enters a superposition of two 
paths ( transmition and reflection paths), then we are arrange two mirrors to reflect these photon beams together again at a second beam splitter , here the photon
beams interfere , say that they merge into a single transmitted beam. So if this situation happens means there is no bomb inside the box.


Condition 2 ) --> (There is a Bomb)
Now what is place a bomb between one of the photon beam path, And now when photon reache the bomb , the bomb will measure  which path the photon is in , which will 
collapse the photon superpostion into either the top or bottom path. Now as if photon collapse with the bottom path, then the bomb will explodes, and if the photon 
collapses with the top part and then reach the second beam splitter , and that will split into  a superposition of being transmitted or reflected. So if we detect the 
photon is reflected after the second beam splitter we know for sure that there is a bomb inside the box without having set it off.
