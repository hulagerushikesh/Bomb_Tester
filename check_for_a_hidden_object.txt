Project Name --> Bomb Tester using Quantum Programming.


Task --> Check whether there is a bomb inside abox or not.

Language --> quiskit (python)

Tool --> Jupyter.


Problem Description --> Your given a box or a closed container and you have determine whether the box is empty or it contains highly sensitive bomb.

Cause due the problem --> As when your working in a lab where there are chemicals or explosive materials are in the air , and if the box contains the bomb
			  and when it got in contact of the free photon it will explode or if there is a unknown bag or box you have found and it may contain 
			  a bomb or may be not but detection of the object inside that unknown bag is too important. The results may leads very very harmful.

Approach --> Measuring the qubit which will tells us whether or not to predict the that the bomb is inside the box or not.


In deep --> We are going to have the qubit to represent our photon and a qubit to represent our bomb , then a beam splitter, and hardmard gates to make a quantum ciruit.

Now lets understand the concept for getting more detail in order to get idea about this factors we are going to use.

Condition 1 ) --> (No Bomb)
Now we are going to have an arrangement of a beam splitter as shown in figure below , now when the photon hits the beam splitter , it enters a superposition of two 
paths ( transmition and reflection paths), then we are arrange two mirrors to reflect these photon beams together again at a second beam splitter , here the photon
beams interfere , say that they merge into a single transmitted beam. So if this situation happens means there is no bomb inside the box.


Condition 2 ) --> (There is a Bomb)
Now what is place a bomb between one of the photon beam path, And now when photon reache the bomb , the bomb will measure  which path the photon is in , which will 
collapse the photon superpostion into either the top or bottom path. Now as if photon collapse with the bottom path, then the bomb will explodes, and if the photon 
collapses with the top part and then reach the second beam splitter , and that will split into  a superposition of being transmitted or reflected. So if we detect the 
photon is reflected after the second beam splitter we know for sure that there is a bomb inside the box without having set it off.
